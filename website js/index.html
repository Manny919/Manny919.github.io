                        <h5>Rules for the offense</h5>
                        <p>
                            The player must bounce, or dribble, the ball with one hand while
                            moving both feet. If, at any time, both hands touch the ball or
                            the player stops dribbling, the player must only move one foot.
                            The foot that is stationary is called the pivot foot.

                        <h5>Rules for the offense</h5>
                        <p>
                            The basketball player can only take one turn at dribbling. In
                            other words, once a player has stopped dribbling they cannot
                            start another dribble. A player who starts dribbling again is
                            called for a double-dribbling violation and looses the
                            basketball to the other team.

                        <h5>Rules for the offense</h5>
                        <p>
                            The ball must stay in bounds. If the offensive team looses the
                            ball out of bounds the other team gets control of the
                            basketball.

                            Although the foul rule is described above as a defensive rule,
                            it applies exactly the same to all players on the court
                            including offensive players.

                            Basketball players cannot kick the ball or hit it with their
                            fist.

                        <p>
                            No player can touch the basketball while it is traveling
                            downward towards the basket or if it is on the rim. This is
                            called goaltending. (touching the ball on the rim is legal in
                            some games).
